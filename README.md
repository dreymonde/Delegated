**Delegated** is a super small package that helps you avoid retain cycles when using closure-based delegation.

Original Medium post (Delegated 0.1.2) [here](https://medium.com/anysuggestion/preventing-memory-leaks-with-swift-compile-time-safety-49b845df4dc6).

> ðŸš¨ WARNING!  **Delegated 2.0 & 3.0** are not compatible with **Delegated 0.1.2**. If you don't want to migrate your current codebase, stay on Delegated 0.1.2. See documentation for Delegated 0.1.2 [here](https://github.com/dreymonde/Delegated/tree/0.1.2). If you need any help migrating from 0.1.x to 2.0.x, please open an issue.

> ðŸš¨ WARNING!  **Delegated 3.0** uses variadic types which is only available on newer platforms and in Swift 5.9. If you don't want to migrate your current codebase, stay on Delegated 2.2.0. See documentation for Delegated 2.2.0 [here](https://github.com/dreymonde/Delegated/tree/2.2.0). If you need any help migrating from 2.x to 3.x, please open an issue.

## Usage

### Before:

```swift
final class TextField {
    var didUpdate: (String) -> () = { _ in }
}

// later...

self.textField.didUpdate = { [weak self] text in
    guard let strongSelf = self else {
        return
    }
    strongSelf.label.text = text
}
```

### After:

```swift
final class TextField {
    @Delegated var didUpdate: (String) -> ()
}

// later...

textField.$didUpdate.delegate(to: self) { (self, text) in
    // `self` is weak automatically!
    self.label.text = text
}
```


No retain cycles! No memory leaks! No `[weak self]`! ðŸŽ‰

## Guide

### Creating a delegated function

```swift
final class TextField {
    @Delegated var didUpdate: (String) -> ()
}
```

You can also use `@Delegated` with any number of parameters:

```swift
final class TextField {
    @Delegated var didStartEditing: () -> Void
    @Delegated var didUpdate: (String) -> Void
    @Delegated var didReplace: (String, String) -> Void
}
```

### Registering as a delegate

```swift
// somewhere inside init() or viewDidLoad() or similar
self.textField = TextField()
textField.$didUpdate.delegate(to: self) { (self, text) in
    self.label.text = text
}
```

By default, `delegate(to:with:)` will wrap `self` in a weak reference so that you don't need to remember to write `[weak self]` every time. This is the main feature of **Delegated**, but if this is not the behavior you want, you can use `manuallyDelegate(with:)`:

```swift
// somewhere inside init() or viewDidLoad() or similar
self.textField = TextField()
textField.$didUpdate.manuallyDelegate { (text) in
    print(text)
}
```

### Calling a delegate

```swift
final class TextField {
    @Delegated var didUpdate: (String) -> Void
    
    /// ...
    
    private func didFinishEditing() {
        self.didUpdate(self.text)
    }
}
```

### Delegating a function with a return value

If your delegated function is designed to have a return value (non-Void), use `@ReturningDelegated` wrapper.

```swift
final class TextField {
    @ReturningDelegated var shouldReturn: (String) -> Bool?
    @ReturningDelegated var shouldBeginEditing: () -> Bool?
    @ReturningDelegated var shouldReplace: (String, String) -> Bool?
}

// ...

textField.$shouldReturn.delegate(to: self) { (self, string) -> Bool in
    if string.count > 5 {
        return true
    } else {
        return false
    }
}
```

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure that your `@ReturningDelegated` function returns **an optional**. It will return `nil` if no delegate is set.

### Removing a delegate

```swift
@Delegated var didUpdate: (String) -> ()
// ...
self.$didUpdate.removeDelegate()
```

### Piping a delegate

Use `pipa(via:to:)` function to quickly pass delegation up the chain

```swift
final class Button {
    @Delegated var didPress: () -> Void
}

final class Alert {
    @Delegated var didConfirm: () -> Void
    @Delegated var didCancel: () -> Void
    
    let confirmButton = Button()
    let cancelButton = Button()
    
    func didLoad() {
        confirmButton.$didPress.pipe(via: self, to: \.$didConfirm)
        cancelButton.$didPress.pipe(via: self, to: \.$didCancel)
    }
}
```

For `@ReturningDelegate`, use `pipa(via:through:)` function

## Installation

#### Swift Package Manager

**Delegated** is officially available *only* via Swift Package Manager.

In Xcode 11 or greater, in you project, select: `File > Swift Packages > Add Pacakage Dependency`

In the search bar type

```
https://github.com/dreymonde/Delegated
``` 

and when you find the package, with the **next** button you can proceed with the installation.

If you can't find anything in the panel of the Swift Packages you probably haven't added yet your github account.
You can do that under the **Preferences** panel of your Xcode, in the **Accounts** section.

For command-line based apps, you can just add this directly to your **Package.swift** file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/dreymonde/Delegated", from: "2.1.0"),
]
```

#### Manual

Of course, you always have an option of just copying-and-pasting the code - **Delegated** is just one file, so feel free.
